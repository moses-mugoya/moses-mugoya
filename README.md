### Hi, I'm Moses Mugoya
I embarked on my journey as a backend developer, drawn to Python's versatility and the endless possibilities it offered. Over the span of 4 years, I honed my skills and delved deep into the backend realm, relishing every challenge it brought.

But my thirst for knowledge knew no bounds. Intrigued by the dynamic nature of React, I ventured into the world of frontend development, immersing myself in JavaScript and TypeScript. The web became my canvas, and with each line of code, I painted new experiences and learned invaluable lessons.

Yet, my curiosity didn't end there. Flutter beckoned with its promise of cross-platform magic. Determined to expand my horizons, I embarked on a journey of Flutter development, embracing the challenges and triumphs it brought.

In parallel, I've recently delved into the captivating world of machine learning and AI, fascinated by the possibilities they hold. As I continue to explore these cutting-edge technologies, my journey as a developer remains a perpetual quest for knowledge and growth.

Today, with over 3 years of experience in frontend and Flutter development, I proudly wear the badge of a full-stack developer. But my journey doesn't end here; it's a continuous adventure fueled by passion and curiosity. Join me as I push the boundaries of what's possible and explore new horizons. Check out my projects below and witness the culmination of my passion and dedication.
